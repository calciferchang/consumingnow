# 0008

happy monday.

## things that happened

- I have gotten my first-ever PSL. I am whelmed.
- I’m currently learning nvim, something that’s interesting because I’ve recently written on the importance of [[sticking stock]]. There’s always been a bit of a duality in my mind— I want to use the simplest tool possible (which in this case, would probably to just use VSCode) but I’m always looking for the most efficient way to work which involves a lot of working inefficiently. Not sure how those two coexist quite yet.
- I’m thinking about turning this website into a bit of an archive/growing repository for my thoughts and writing. A lot of what I’ve shared has been really stream of consciousness writing and I want to have something a little more structured. I imagine that this project turns into a living home of my mind where anyone can look in and see how my ideas come to be, grow, and evolve.
- I’ve been starting to get into reading articles again— I stopped around the end of 2024 because it started making me depressed but I found that I missed the information I absorb from it. I love reading opinions & editorials, hearing others’ thoughts and perspectives, whether or not I agree with them. I’ve been reading a lot of Zeynep Tufekçi’s writing, it’s also caused an interest in studying sociology in the future. Some of my favorite recent reads by her:
  - [The A.O.C. Deepfake Was Terrible. The Proposed Solution Is Delusional.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/11/opinion/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-deepfake-ai.html) How “critical thinking” alone is not the solution to AI.
  - [Social Media Reduced Two Horrific Killings to Cheap Snuff Films](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/opinion/the-flood-of-moment-of-death-videos-is-killing-us.html) Is social media desensitizing us to horrific events?
  - [For One Hilarious, Terrifying Day, Elon Musk’s Chatbot Lost Its Mind](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/opinion/grok-ai-musk-x-south-africa.html)
  - [The Rage and Glee That Followed a C.E.O.’s Killing Should Ring All Alarms](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/opinion/united-health-care-ceo-shooting.html)
    I keep rereading and resharing. I feel it keeps being relevant.
- I’ve been thinking a lot about the role of AI in education. As someone who is self-taught in many areas of life, AI has been invaluable in making learning more accessible. However, I am not blind to how it is effectively a cheat code for many. I feel like there’s a connection to how [digital literacy is in decline](https://www.edweek.org/technology/u-s-students-computer-literacy-performance-drops/2024/12) [(along with literacy in general)](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/09/whats-driving-decline-in-u-s-literacy-rates/)
- [Photos from my photography class](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tf6BxHtojY36cFDhVmGK18onPmYJeRn_?usp=sharing). I’m planning to have a section of this for projects where I can capture things I’m working on continuously but that’s still very much WIP.

## thoughts

- [[Stop looking for perfect people]]
- Thinking about writing an article on why everyone should write their own weekly. Or at least, something similar to help us be more grounded as time passes.
