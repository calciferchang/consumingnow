If [Congress can say that two years can constitute one calendar day](https://www.ntu.org/publications/detail/when-is-a-calendar-day-not-a-calendar-day-and-why-does-it-matter) I can say that last week’s newsletter is releasing on a Tuesday. It’s been a messy week, but in a way that I’m very thankful for. School just began last week and it’s been demanding, even though it was expected.

> note: in the writing of this sentence, someone just spilled their drink all over their laptop. i feel for them and suppose that as rough as my week has been, it could be worse.

A lot of the struggles have been relating to getting stuff done. In the past, I’ve struggled with motivation but this week its been mostly attention and energy (or at least, moreso than usual[^1]). I’m not sure if it’s a result of the school semester starting and my brain trying to get used to it again or if this is simply another one of life’s ebbs and flows. Whichever it is, it’s had me thinking more on how i spend my time and energy in the face of the lack of it.

At its worst, my attention feels scattered and dispersed; try as I might, nothing is being processed. I think that I’m realizing that my energy can be compared to a single charge in a battery. Whatever the charge is at when the day begins, that’s what I have to work with today and once it’s empty, that’s all I have until tomorrow. What I’ve been starting to find some success with is putting the highest effort, highest priority things first[^2] and checking in with myself throughout the day to make sure I’m not burning myself out.

Being aware that I only really have so much energy in the day has made me think more on what I’m prioritizing with what I’m spending my energy on and really making me question what I value in my day-to-day. For example, shitposting on the internet can be amusing but really isn’t fulfilling (and at times is detrimental to my social life) but it’s really _easy_ to do. This newsletter, on the other hand, is incredibly fulfilling but requires a lot of effort and commitment to even write and curate, let alone things like building a website or styling. This dynamic of things has been on my mind a lot recently, I feel like many things today have become rather shallow: intended to be easily accessible, consumable, and addictive but wholly unfulfilling. Fast food. Social media. Hollywood. Video games. To me, this is the value of curation— when everything in our life is vying for our attention, we gain the power to decide what we choose to do with it.

# on the mind

Luddism has been on the mind recently with the rise of anti-AI sentiment. It’s interesting how the sentiments from from a couple centuries ago with the beginning of industrialization became relevant again 10 years ago with the rise of big tech and are once again resurgent with the growth of AI. In doing research on the topic, I found [this article from 2013 that feels once again relevant](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/krugman-sympathy-for-the-luddites.html?_r=0) ([alt link](https://web.archive.org/web/20250821025519/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/krugman-sympathy-for-the-luddites.html?_r=0)). The author quotes the woolworkers of the 18th century— “‘Who will maintain our families, whilst we undertake the arduous task’ of learning a new trade? Also, they asked, what will happen if the new trade, in turn, gets devalued by further technological advance?”

Today, almost 60% of bachelor’s degree holders graduate in debt, each owing 30k on average. Housing prices have just about [doubled in the past 50 years (accounting for inflation)](https://www.longtermtrends.net/home-price-vs-inflation/) with houses being [more expensive than ever compared to household income](https://www.longtermtrends.net/home-price-median-annual-income-ratio/). [Cost of living has skyrocketed](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1977) while [pay has stagnated](https://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/). In the current political and economic landscape, it’s simply not feasible nor reasonable to ask everyone displaced by structural unemployment to re-educate themselves and as a result the opposition to AI being so staunch is unsurprising: most people _cannot afford_ to fail and to many, it represents another effort by the wealthiest to extract value from the 99%.

Today, Luddism is remembered as a foolish endeavor to resist progress yet we see their arguments resurfacing in conversations on the legality and ethicality of AI, especially in the context of their relation to corporate cost-cutting. However, as the Luddites’ failure has proven to us, progress _is_ inevitable and structural unemployment an unfortunate consequence of it. With this acknowledgment, I agree with Krugman that the only solution is “having a strong social safety net, one that guarantees not just health care but a minimum income, too.” While this support system is bemoaned by many in my country, I wonder what their substitute would be given how compared to last year [our current administration has already spent 7% more than the last one](https://web.archive.org/web/20250907232933/https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/) ([which was already grossly overspending](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/09/27/chart-of-the-week-the-bipartisan-federal-debt-limit/)) and is [projected to increase the deficit substantially ](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-one-big-beautiful-bill-act), all while cutting support for the people. (i don’t have time to find all the sources for this and they would be almost immediately outdated if i did.)

# what i’m doing.

I just finished my first week of classes, which has substantially increased my mental overhead. (i attribute the delay of this to the increase in work alongside writing taking significantly longer that i anticipated)

One of my first projects is on exploring relationships between images and text. The structure of the deliverable is simple, three 8.5x11 with a 7x7 image and one word in 30pt Helvetica Light. However, the simplicity is my favorite part of the project and I’ve has a lot of fun exploring the different ways I can manipulate the perception of the te
