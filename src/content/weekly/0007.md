hello again, friday. it’s been a busy week and it’s hard to imagine that the week is “over” again. thing is, i don’t think it’s ever going to be less so and i don’t know if i want it to be. i think in a way, being busy and overworked has forced me to overcome many aspects of my perfectionism. as of late, i simply don’t have time to try and get everything perfect and it’s pushed me to really identify what it is that i value and am trying to achieve and finding the best way to get there. being busy and especially writing this newsletter has made me more conscious of every minute, each means more, feels more precious. i don’t have the time anymore to worry about whether or not something is good enough or not, whether i’m good enough or not, at some point, it just needs to be done.

i’ve felt FOMO in the past on the things that i haven’t managed to get done or haven’t been satisfied with completing which being busy has really helped me with. i’ve been able to come to peace with the fact that i’m not going to be good enough sometimes but each time i’m learning more about what i’m not good at, which will eventually let me see improvement as i learn what i previously did not know. kind of related to my ramble from before.

## schoolwork:

- continuing to learn on image/text relationships. the main word i’m analyzing is “consumption”. i’m not super happy on where i am with this so far, I feel as though it leans too deeply into a Luddite perspective that I’m not interested in exploring or arguing. i think what i want to get at is how media and capitalism pushes us to consume addictively while obfuscating its costs. capitalism tries to tie consumption to our identity so that consuming is a tenet of our existence.
- creative coding:
  - [“Leave a note”](https://editor.p5js.org/calciferchang/sketches/cfEibT_z6)
  - [“how did i start doing trig”](https://editor.p5js.org/calciferchang/sketches/cfEibT_z6)
- also been doing photography. got a fuji xt50, i think it’s really gorgeous, i need to actually edit the photos and figure out a way to upload them somewhere.

i’m thinking about taking extra courses at Type@Cooper. i wonder if that would be pushing myself too much but i think i would rather drown myself and learn my limits than play it safe and never know where they are.

## productivity

![[image-20250919194005484]] my home screen: been playing a lot more with productivity tools. i think that’s something i’ve been really obsessive over, trying to optimize in that way. currently, i use

- Apple Mail, Reminders & Calendar
- OneFolder for photo/asset organization
- Anybox for bookmarks
- Obsidian for journaling, using Templater & Apple shortcuts for optimization
- Alfred for accessing my files better on MacOS.

frameworks & stuff:

- PARA, the structure by Tiago Forte (Projects, Areas, References, Archive).
- Inbox 0

things im reading

- Newsletters: cargo.site, the creative independent, dieline, design reviewed
- NYT for articles.
- I haven’t had time to read books this week, unfortunately.

Thinking about learning vim now.

## thinking again about some essay ideas:

- the need to take ownership & responsibility over our data
  - my assignment is making me think more on what we consume and how and it’s brought to mind how we’ve started just taking storage for granted with the invention of the cloud. when we upload things, we assume that it will still be there when we return. is it dissimilar from putting things in a gallery or a locker room? though their purpose is to keep them safe, can we really trust them to always be there?
  - I tend to be very skeptical of cloud-based products, not out of worry for them losing data ([though that technically can happen](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/)), but because there isn’t really an incentive for them to keep it. Polyvore, a company founded in 2007, was intended to be a platform to facilitate online shopping, the idea being to provide users with a canvas to collect and put together outfits with images, earning Polyvore revenue through affiliate links from purchases. However, Polyvore found an audience entirely different from its intended one: “very young women who couldn't afford the designer clothes they were interested in.” For them, “Polyvore offered a way of engaging with beautiful things for free. Fashion as a mode of expression goes far beyond what you wear or even what you wish you could afford to own.” These are writings by an Are.na user by the name of Jill Blackmore, the curator of [The Polyvore Archive](https://www.are.na/jill-blackmore/the-polyvore-archive), a channel that serves as an archive of Polyvore posts after it’s sudden closure after being acquired by Ssense. Its closure was not widely discussed outside of posts and forums, something likely due to the marginalized nature of its users. The images in this archive were later discovered in datasets used for machine learning. It speaks as a warning that despite the milennial warnings that whatever goes on the internet will be on there forever, that only remains true until it ceases to hold value for those paying for its storage. We should not rely on corporations to have our best interests at heart (something noted in every Privacy Policy that can be updated without notice) and should not expect them to. If something is important to us, we should take action to preserve it, a mentality that can be applied to many things on this earth.
  - Cost of storage— The cloud allows us to be ignorant of the cost of hoarding. Data centers in the US consume 9% of the annual power demand, projected to increase to 12% by 2030. More than half of this power is fueled by fossil fuels, not to mention the water costs which I frankly struggle to even visualize.

  - This is related to my thoughts on the importance of curation as by saving what is important to us, we will realize what is not, further allowing us to eliminate the need for storing everything
  - I have some thoughts on the myth of “everything on the internet will be there forever.” this is only true as long as people want to preserve something: movies, porn, video games, things that people want. If the main person who something is important to is you, you should probably save it.
