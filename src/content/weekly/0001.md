# _what i’ve been thinking_

recently, i’ve been obsessed with understanding the different ways we express ourselves, particularly in how we spend our resources whether that be time, money, or even just attention. in myself, i’ve been thinking about what i dedicate my time to, how much of it, and how ‘deeply’ i spend that time. even just writing this piece, i wonder what that reflects about myself.

i feel like in general, i struggle to vocalize the traits that make me distinct; it wasn’t until someone commented on my “trademark sarcasm” that this whole train of thought started. i admire people who can, or at least those who have a more focused definition of themselves. for example, [naz hamid’s modus operandi](https://nazhamid.com/journal/modus-operandi/) or [adam parkzer’s short about me](https://parkzer.com/).

part of the admiration comes from their transparency; one of my current grievances with digital communications is how it feels people’s digital personas differ so drastically from their physical ones. the most prominent examples to me are (1) gaming, which is notorious for this, with anonymity allowing strangers to liberated to be their worst selves and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) (which ironically, has the entirely opposite identity dynamic), where people create hyper-curated versions of themselves for personal gain. on a tangent, it’s amusing to me that with llms, the platform edges ever closer to the [dead internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) (though don’t get me started on how chatgpt ruined the em dash).

# _what i’ve been doing_

soldering has allowed me to rediscover my love for building keyboards. here’s the most recent one i’ve done that was both my favorite (currently typing on it!) and also the most painful, being bluetooth. funnily, soldering the battery was the most straightforward part of it all.

aside from that, i’ve been getting back into coding after a long break (i started teaching myself like two years ago and only just getting back into it…), reading more, and playing teamfight tactics.

# _what i’m (currently) reading_

# _wayside flowers_

things i’ve come across that you might enjoy

- [Monokai: a trip through Japan](https://monokai.nl/2019/japan/): a beautiful visual experience created to showcase photos from a trip in Japan.
- [Devouring Details](https://devouringdetails.com/): a course/resource on interaction design. a little pricey but has a student discount. in my limited, unprofessional experience, i’ve found it to be quite engaging and really opened my eyes to more subtle aspects in ui/ux.
- [How to run a small social network site for your friends](https://runyourown.social/). something i’ve wanted to share for a while. i love reading about ways to use the internet to foster bonds deeper than the superficial ones that overpopulate the internet today. it seems like something i would love to do but haven’t found a reason to.
- [Dear Data](https://www.dear-data.com/all)
